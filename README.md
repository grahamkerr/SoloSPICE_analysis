# SoloSPICE_analysis

A selection of codes and notebooks for analysing Solar Orbiter SPICE data. 

These are primarily a way to easily interface with Sunraster, and sospice, both of which you will need to download:

https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/sunraster/en/latest/index.html

https://sospice.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

Other packages are standard (e.g. astropy, numpy, etc.,). 

Most methods are a work-in-progress. Feel free to get in touch or contribute if you have a better way of implementing various things.
